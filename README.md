## About the Project
**Corrupted Virtues** is a tactical RPG set in the mythological land of Areti. Players lead a Guardian angel through corrupted regions, purifying the Seven Virtues that govern the land.  

The game combines **grid-based combat** with **QuickTimeEvents (QTE)** to enhance attacks and player engagement. Inspired by *Gladius*’s combat system and *Paper Mario’s* timing mechanics, the game focuses on strategic positioning and party-based tactics.
